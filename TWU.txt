Personal Perspective - Please make a brief statement describing your personal relationship with Christ and a second statement expressive of your philosophy of Christian education, especially indicating 1. How you see your discipline in relation to the total Christian academic enterprise; and, 2. Why you would wish to teach at an Evangelical Christian institution like Trinity Western University. 

#Personal Perspective
My faith is grounded in an affirmation of the truths expressed in evangelical protestant statements of faith (such as TWU's statement), as well as active trust that, despite my sinful nature, I have been forgiven and have been declared righteous through the death and resurrection of Christ. I look forward to the new creation.

*As an educator, I believe that online education is enabling a time of unprecedented access to highly effective learning environments and experiences. Never before have we had such access to technologies that allow the building of distributed learning communities to promote learning in traditional and emerging academic disciplines. Advances in technology are creating demand among students for learning experiences that are flexible, credible, and supportive. Through the study and application of the principles of online and distance learning, it is possible to extend access to effective and engaging learning environments to those who might not otherwise be able to participate.

*I wish to teach at TWU to build capacity for online learning in higher education in general and, more specifically at a Christian institution like TWU, to increase access to effective learning environments and experiences grounded in the reasonableness of the Christian worldview. I would argue that online learning is one of the 'marketplaces of life' into which TWU has not yet extended her reach. I would like to help make that happen.
